# Agent Jake Browser MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI agents to automate Chrome browser interactions.

## Overview

This server implements the MCP protocol to expose browser automation tools to AI agents like Claude. It works in conjunction with [agent-jake-browser-mcp-extension](https://github.com/SnakeO/agent-jake-browser-mcp-extension) to provide full browser control.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnakeO/agent-jake-browser-mcp-server.git
cd agent-jake-browser-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/agent-jake-browser-mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### With VS Code / Cursor

Add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "browser": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/agent-jake-browser-mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Infrastructure

Docker recipes, healthchecks and Kubernetes manifests belong to the house
infrastructure repository. StaticDuo's extraction destination is
`nas-docker/mcp/agent-jake-browser/`; its `migration-source.json` records hashes
of the infrastructure copied from server SHA `846dab66`.

Build this product with `npm ci && npm run build`. Infrastructure consumes the
root artifacts `dist/index.js` (stdio) and `dist/http-server.js` (HTTP).
The compatibility command `node http-server.js` also runs compiled HTTP.
The HTTP listener defaults to loopback; a deployment that changes the bind host
must provide its own authenticated proxy and network boundary.

### CLI Options

```bash
node dist/index.js [options]

Options:
  --port <number>    WebSocket port for extension connection (default: 8765)
  --verbose          Enable verbose logging
  --help             Show help
```

## Several browsers, tokens and pairing

More than one browser can be attached at the same time. Each extension install
connects with its own `connectionId`, and every tool accepts an optional
`connection` argument choosing which browser runs the call. Without it the
server targets the most recently used connection, so single-browser setups keep
working exactly as before.

```json
{ "name": "browser_navigate", "arguments": { "url": "https://example.com", "connection": "chrome-office" } }
```

`browser_list_connections` answers with the live browsers (id, label, user agent,
last activity and which one is active) and is answered by the server itself, so it
also works while nothing is connected.

### Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BROWSER_WS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address of the extension WebSocket. Set `0.0.0.0` when a reverse proxy reaches it from outside the container. |
| `BROWSER_WS_PORT` | `8765` | Extension WebSocket port. |
| `BROWSER_WS_TOKEN` | empty | Shared token required in the handshake (`?token=`). Empty disables static auth. |
| `BROWSER_ALLOW_PAIRING` | `false` | `true` also accepts tokens issued by the pairing web. Auth is on when this or the static token is set. |
| `BROWSER_TOKEN_STORE` | `/app/data/tokens.json` | JSON file where issued tokens live, so they survive a restart. Mount a volume for the path. |
| `BROWSER_EXTENSION_ZIP` | `/app/extension/agent-jake-browser-extension.zip` | Archive served at `/download`. |
| `BROWSER_EXTENSION_DIR` | `/data/extension` | Folder where the extension CI publishes `latest.json` and `agent-jake-browser-extension.zip`. `/download` serves that zip when it exists (an explicit `BROWSER_EXTENSION_ZIP` wins); `/download/latest.json` serves the manifest. |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_CONNECTION_LABELS` | unset | JSON `{"<connectionId>": "<name>"}`: friendly names (`"work"`, `"home"`) accepted wherever a `connection` is. Legacy endpoint only. |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_CONNECTION` | unset | Browser (id or name) an MCP session uses until it picks one. With it, a session never falls back to "most recently used". Legacy endpoint only. |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_OP_BIN` | `op` | Executable `browser_fill_secret` runs as `<bin> read <op://ref>` on the server. A deployment can point it at a wrapper that picks the 1Password backend. |
| `BROWSER_PUBLIC_WS_URL` | derived | Full `ws(s)://host/path` handed to the extension. Use it when the proxy mapping is not derivable from the request. |
| `BROWSER_WS_PATH` | `/` | Path advertised to the extension, for proxies that map the socket to a subpath. |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` / `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `8000` | MCP streamable HTTP endpoint. |
| `BROWSER_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | derived | Origin used to build the approval link returned by `/pair/start`. Set it when the proxy host is not derivable from the request. |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_OUT_DIR` | system temp dir | Where `browser_pdf` and tool results saved with `filename` write their files. |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_DROP_DIR` | unset (file drops disabled) | Directory of files available to `browser_drop`. Files must be direct children, with no symlinks; maximum 8 files and 10 MiB total per call. Mount only files intended for browser upload. MIME data-only drops remain available with a 1 MiB limit. |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_ALLOW_UNSAFE_CODE` | unset (disabled) | Set exactly `1` to enable `browser_run_code_unsafe`, which executes arbitrary JavaScript in the MCP server process. Only use it with fully trusted MCP clients. |

PDFs and network or console results written with a path must be direct children of
`AGENT_BROWSER_OUT_DIR` (or the system temp directory by default). Existing files
are never overwritten; choose a new name for each result. Secure file drops and
server-side output files currently require Linux (`/proc/self/fd`); they fail
closed on other platforms. Data-only drops and inline tool results still work.

`browser_network_request` returns metadata and headers by default. Only values
of `content-type` (MIME type only), `content-length` (digits only), and
`cache-control` (known directives only) remain visible; other header values
are redacted. Network URLs show only the origin, never the path, query,
userinfo or fragment. Request or response bodies require an explicit `part`
because they can contain credentials or private form data. Custom header names
can also carry private data, so use these tools only with trusted MCP clients.

### HTTP surface

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /mcp` (plus `GET`/`DELETE`) | MCP streamable HTTP endpoint. |
| `GET /` | Small page with the download link, the pairing link and the live connection list. |
| `GET /download` | Serves the extension zip (`BROWSER_EXTENSION_ZIP`, else the one published in `BROWSER_EXTENSION_DIR`, else the image's). |
| `GET /download/latest.json` | The published extension build `{version, build, sha, publishedAt, download}`; `404` when none was published. Read by installed extensions to tell their user a newer build exists. |
| `GET /connections` | JSON: auth status, derived wsUrl and the current connections. |
| `POST /pair/start` | Extension registers a one-time code (`{otp, connectionId?, label?}`), valid 10 minutes. |
| `GET /pair` | Approval page, prefilled from `?otp=`. |
| `POST /pair/approve` | `{otp}` → `{token, wsUrl}`; `410` when expired, unknown or already used. |
| `GET /pair/status?otp=` | `pending` \| `approved` \| `expired`, with the token once approved. |

Pairing means each install gets its own token instead of sharing one secret: the
extension shows a code, a human approves it in the browser, and the issued token is
stored on disk and accepted by the WebSocket handshake afterwards.

### Download with the server address baked in

When `BROWSER_PUBLIC_WS_URL` is set, `/download` injects a root-level `config.json`
into the archive before sending it:

```json
{ "version": 1, "wsUrl": "wss://agent-browser.staticduo.com/ws" }
```

The template mounted at `BROWSER_EXTENSION_ZIP` stays read-only and untouched; the
patched archive is built in memory and cached until the template or the URL changes.
Without `BROWSER_PUBLIC_WS_URL` the template is served byte for byte, and no token is
ever written into the archive — authentication comes from pairing.

[calls browser_snapshot]

AI: I can see the form fields. Let me fill in your name.
[calls browser_type with ref="e12", text="John Doe"]

AI: Now I'll click the submit button.
[calls browser_click with ref="e15"]
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Development with watch
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

## Project Structure

```text
packages/
  core/
    src/
      product.ts       # Importable API; no listener starts on import
      cli/             # Compiled stdio and HTTP process entrypoints
      http/            # HTTP routes and existing pairing/download pages
      server.ts        # MCP server
      context.ts       # Browser communication
      ws-server.ts     # WebSocket authentication and routing
      tools/           # Shared tools and pinned-directory safeguards
      utils/           # Shared utilities
    tests/             # Product tests, including HTTP process integration
  house-staticduo/     # Identity and composition only
  house-pocharlies/    # Identity and composition only
tests/integration/    # Browser E2E; extension artifact supplied by configuration
entrypoints/          # Root dist compatibility wrappers
```

The root owns the only lockfile. `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`,
`npm run build`, `npm start` and `npm run dev` remain root commands.
The two house packages compose the same core; they contain no tool copies,
domains, credentials or deployment configuration.

Browser integration uses an unpacked extension artifact supplied through
`BROWSER_EXTENSION_PATH` (default `./test-artifacts/extension`). It never
requires a neighboring checkout. Example after building the server:

```sh
BROWSER_EXTENSION_PATH=/path/to/pinned/extension npm run test:e2e
```
